# LSystem - Python Implementation
1. Firstly, this project is still an educational one.
2. This project supports rendering multiple trees with any kind of rules.
3. I am currently using pillow for rendering, so my project does not support 3d systems.
4. I do not recommend setting the number of generations in ONE tree to more than 12, as this can lead to a **MemoryError**.
